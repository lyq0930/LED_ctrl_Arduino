/*
 * IRLib: IRrecvPCIDump - dump details of IR codes with IRrecvPCI ("IR Receiver Pin Change Interrupts")
 * -The advantage of using IRrecvPCI instead of IRrecv is that is REQUIRES NO TIMERS TO RECEIVE!
 * 
 * Circuit:
 *  An IR detector/demodulator must be connected to the proper External Interrupt pin in use, 
 *  based on your particular Arduino; see here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt
 * 
 * -TO STOP USING TIMERS: If you are *only* receiving IR data, and not sending IR data, you can 
 *  completely free your timer that this library would otherwise use by going to IRLib.h and 
 *  commenting out the line that says "#define USE_IRRECV". 
 * 
 * -TO SAVE PROGRAM SPACE: If not using either dumpResults methods of IRdecode nor IRfrequency you can
 *  comment out the "#define USE_DUMP" line in IRLib.h, to save considerable program space.
 * -See IRLib.h for more details, options, & info.

Notes on Mark_Excess:
~By Gabriel Staples, 30 Jan. 2016 
Try different values here for Mark_Excess. 50us is a good starting guess. Ken Shirriff originally used 100us. 
It is assumed that your IR receiver filters the modulated signal such that Marks (LOW periods
from the IR receiver) are several dozen microseconds too long and Spaces (HIGH periods from the
IR receiver) are the same amount too short. This is the case for most IR receivers. Therefore, 
IRLib automatically *subtracts* Mark_Excess from Marks and *adds* Mark_Excess to Spaces 
after receiving the raw IR data, and before decoding it. 
If using the dirt-cheap (<$1 for 10) 1838 IR receivers from Ebay, however, 
I recommend setting Mark_Excess to -31us for IRrecv, and -37us for IRrecvPCI. If using the 
higher quality TSOP4838 ones, I recommend setting Mark_Excess to +45us for IRrecv, and +55us
for IRrecvPCI. If Mark_Excess is off by too much, your IR receiver will 
appear not to work correctly at all, and will not properly decode IR signals. To evaluate
your receiver, run the "IRanalyze.ino" sketch and carefully compare your outputs to what you 
should be getting for your particular protocol. You can find the timing values for each 
protocol in the decode functions of this library, ex: "IRdecodeNEC::decode" lists the timing
values used when decoding the very popular NEC protocol.

#include <IRLib.h>

//specify External Interrupt number (which corresponds to an input pin)
//Ex: for Arduino Uno/Duemilanove/Nano/Pro Mini, etc (ATmega328), External Interrupt 0 is Pin 2, External Interrupt 1 is Pin 3
//-for more boards see here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt
const byte EXT_INTERRUPT_NUMBER = 0; //Pin 2 for ATmega328-based boards, like the Uno
IRrecvPCI My_Receiver(EXT_INTERRUPT_NUMBER);

/*
OPTIONAL: SINGLE VS DOUBLE-BUFFERING: Create another buffer to enable double-buffering for the IR 
receiver code. If double-buffered, your interrupts will continue to receive new data in the background 
even while you are decoding the last dataset in your main code. If you do *not* use double-buffering,
that is ok too, but you must call resume() after you are done using any decoder functions, such 
as decode() or dumpResults(), and ***any IR data that tries to come in while you are decoding/before
you call resume() will be lost.*** See the extensive notes on buffers in IRLibRData.h for more info.
Note: RAWBUF is defined in IRLib.h.

    functions that use the last data acquired, such as decode and dumpResults; if using a double

    to completely stop receiving, and now want to resume IR receiving.*/
